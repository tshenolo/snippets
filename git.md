### Git

### Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<project>.git
cd <project>
```

You need to fetch the latest commits from the remote repository without merging them
```
git fetch origin
```

After fetching, you can compare your local branch with the remote branch to see which files have changed
```
git diff --name-only origin/main
```

If you want to see the actual changes in the files
```
git diff origin/main
```

### Commit staged changes to the local repository
```
git commit -m "<message>"
```

```
git push --set-upstream origin dev-feature
```

### Switch to the Main Branch:
```
git checkout main
```

### Update the Main Branch:
```
git pull origin main
```
 
### Merge Your Feature Branch into Main:
```
git merge dev-feature

```
git push origin main
```

### [Optional] Delete Your Local Feature Branch:
```
git branch -d dev-feature
```

### [Optional] Delete the Remote Feature Branch:
```
git push origin --delete dev-feature
```

### Keep Your Branch Up to Date
```
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
git checkout dev-feature
git rebase main
